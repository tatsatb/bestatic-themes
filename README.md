## About Bestatic

Bestatic is a simple but powerful static-site generator that you can install graphically without worrying about dependencies, on Windows, macOS, and Linux, running on any x86_64 and ARM architectures. It can simply turn your text files into fully functional websites and blogs. _Any prior knowledge in Python is not required. Neither is any prior knowledge in dependency or environment management._
